# CS370 Machine Learning using a DQN Algorithm

In this project we were given a framework for an intelligent agent and a grid-based maze game. We were asked to provide an algorithm for training the intelligent agent to play the maze and learn how to get to the finish in the least amount of moves. All of the code that I provided for this project resides in the #TODO section of the jupyter notebook file.

Training the agent took many iterations and some experimentation in the approach was done per the design review document. Overall, the intelligent agent was successfully trained to solve the maze in the least amount of steps.

Machine learning is a large and ever-growing field where computer scientists are directly applying the latest technology in order to solve complex problems. This project is a realtively simple demonstration of that. Computer scientists solve problems, an my approach to a problem is to break it down into more solvable tasks. As an example, even this DQN ML algorithm slowly learns by starting with a blank framework and applying an iterative approach.

Finally, ethics is a major concern as the ML field expands. The ethics of any AI must be the responsibility of its creators, keeping in mind that an AI cannot be expected to learn acceptable ethics on its own, in fact, the reverse is often true. This concern must be in the forefront from creation, training, on through deployment of any model.
